This is a tool used at .SE to check the general health of a DNS zone.

The system is split into two major parts: an "engine" part that takes care of
the gathering and manipulation of information, and a web GUI that presents
information to an end user. The parts are implemented as separate sets of Perl
modules. The engine part are the Zonestat modules, and the web GUI are the
Statweb modules. The latter is a Catalyst application, and thus has a lot of
prerequisite modules that are not needed when not using the GUI. The Zonestat
modules also have a whole bunch of prereqs, and those really are required to
use the system at all.

The single biggest prerequisite, and the one that needs most manual work to
install, is DNSCheck. For historical reasons, Zonestat is quite intimately
connected to DNSCheck. The Zonestat database schema is a modified version of
the DNSCheck one, and the two also share configuration files. So the
installation process, in brief, goes like this:

1) Install DNSCheck. Adjust its config with at least database connection
   information. Load the DNSCheck schema file into the database.

2) Install Zonestat. Adjust the DNSCheck config files as necessary. Load the
   Zonestat modifications to the DNSCheck database schema.
   
3) Install Statweb. Install necessary modules to run Catalyst applications in
   your webserver (Apache is the only tested one, but it should work with
   anything). Configure web server to run the Statweb application.
