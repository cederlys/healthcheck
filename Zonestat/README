Zonestat version 0.01
=====================

This module (or set of modules) is written for .SE, the Swedish ccTLD
registry, for them to gather statistics about their zone. Any usability for
other people is as of this writing more or less accidental.

Installation notes:

* Zonestat relies heavily on and reads much configuration from the DNSCheck
  installation. Make sure that installation works.

* One particular thing that may need to be changed is to make sure that the
  DNSCheck message DNS:NAMESERVER_FOUND does get entered into the database,
  either by setting the log filter level low enough in site_config.yaml or by
  changing that message's priority level to something sufficiently high in
  site_policy.yaml
