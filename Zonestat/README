Zonestat version 0.2
====================

This module (or set of modules) is written for .SE, the Swedish ccTLD
registry, for them to gather statistics about their zone. Any usability for
other people is as of this writing more or less accidental.

Installation notes:

* Zonestat by default reads its configuration from 
  $Config{siteprefix} . '/share/zonestat/config.yaml'

* Zonestat relies heavily on the DNSCheck installation. Make sure that
  installation works.

* One thing may have to be changed in the DNSCheck configuration: The DNSCheck
  message DNS:NAMESERVER_FOUND must get entered into the database, either by
  setting the log filter level low enough in site_config.yaml or by changing
  that message's priority level to something sufficiently high in
  site_policy.yaml
